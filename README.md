# A3

GitHub link to the code: https://github.com/fossinating/comp-590-vr-a2
Link to a live version: https://fossinating.com/comp-590-vr-a2/src/

If you'd like to run the code locally on your own machine, you may need to spin up a web server to avoid CORS errors, an easy way to do this would be the VSCode Live Server extension.

## Looking for A2?

Check out the A2 branch of this repo for the A2 source code. Unfortunately there is not currently a great way for me to host a live version of A2 separate from A3.
